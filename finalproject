        <h1>REMEMBERING 9/11</h1>
        <p>I wanted to convey a feeling of sorrow as September 11th, 2001 was an extremely tragic day in NYC. I edited a story using a series of video clips, audio and a picture through cuts and transitions to tell a brief 3min story that unfolds from the ending to beginning. All footage and audio is obtained from archive.org. Creditors include: Kenneth Abramowitz (Skyline Photo) TheAutisticManiac (Twin Towers Photo), JFK1963NEWSVIDEOS (Fox News Video), 911revisited, Know More News (Demolition Video), Bomb sounds (Bomb audio), Jude Connors (Phone Call audio).</p>
